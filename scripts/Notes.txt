Machine Learning Basics:

    -Neurons
        Nodes that can be inputs, hidden, or outputs
    -Weights
        Connections between neurons have weighted
    -Targets
        The final result that the neural network is trying to achieve
    -Loss Function
        Relates the output to the target, and describes how far off it is from the target
    -Activation Function
        Theta(n) = (1)/(1+e^-n)
